## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my evolving portfolio! This repository tracks my progress as I dive into data analysis projects using tools like Python/R, Pandas, and visualizations. Beyond the data, I'm also exploring the fascinating intersection of AI and creativity, documenting experiments in image and video generation using generative AI models to create unique digital versions of my artwork. Watch this space for both insightful analysis and digital art explorations!
